# spotify-api-project

The purpose of this project is to add specific queries to a current users Spotify library. We will use the Spotify API. When there is an appropriate
application, we can make use of Spotipy which will allow us to query Spotify without the complications of API's.

Currently I am working on: 
  - Allowing a user to generate a playlist given a specfic decade based off of their currently saved songs
  
 Future Improvements:
  - Create a front-end interface for accessibility purposes

Note
  The folders containing `...JSONSamples` are there for looking at the output of generated JSONS. This will help us with indexing dictionaries. 


To use this, create a file named `secrets.py` which includes:
  `spotify_token = ""`
  `spotify_user_id = ""`
  `client_id = ""`
  `client_secret = ""`
